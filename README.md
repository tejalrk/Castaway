The current landscape of avatar creation in digital platforms lacks a systematic and reliable approach
that seamlessly integrates advanced generative models and stable diffusion techniques. Existing
methods often grapple with challenges such as convergence issues, unpredictable training
trajectories, and the emergence of artifacts during the generation process. This hinders the production
of avatars with both high visual fidelity and stability. Recognizing these limitations, there is a pressing
need for a novel solution that harnesses the power of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and
specifically incorporates Dreambooth's stable diffusion model to redefine the avatar creation process.
This project aims to address these challenges by providing a comprehensive and innovative
framework for generating avatars that not only exhibit superior aesthetic qualities but also ensure
stability and coherence throughout the training process.
